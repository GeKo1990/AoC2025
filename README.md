Great — here is a **clean, compliant, professional README** you can put at the root of your AoC repository.
It follows Advent of Code copyright rules and looks good on GitHub.

# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — My Solutions

This repository contains **my personal solutions** for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), solved in Go.

Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly programming challenge created by **Eric Wastl**.
Each day during December, one new two-part puzzle unlocks, covering algorithms, data structures, optimizations, and creative problem solving.

## 🚫 About puzzle text & inputs (important)

Per the official rules:

> “Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy.
> Please don't publish the puzzle text or your inputs.”

Therefore:

* **Puzzle descriptions are *not* included** in this repository
* **My personal input files are *not* included**
* Only **solution code**, helper modules, and personal notes (in my own words) are stored here

To read the actual puzzles, please visit:

## 🛠️ Tools & Language

I’m solving the 2025 puzzles using:

* **Go** (Golang)
* Basic command-line utilities
* Occasionally visualization or brute-force helpers

Run a day’s solution with:

```bash
go run main.go < input.txt
```

## 🎯 Goals

* Clean, readable solutions
* Progressive improvement each day
* Exploring algorithmic techniques:

  * bitmasking
  * graph search
  * parsing and DSLs
  * dynamic programming
  * computational geometry
  * optimization tricks
